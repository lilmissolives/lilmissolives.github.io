            I started off doing paintings and sketches since I was young.
            As I grew older, I began pursuing digital illustration and have become proficient in using Paint Tool Sai and Photoshop.

          <p>
            After browsing through many photos on the web, I grew an appreciation for good photography, and was inspired to do the same.
            Armed with a DSLR, I enjoy doing photography as a hobby.
