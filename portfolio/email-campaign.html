        <div class="portfolio-table">
          <div class="portfolio-column-1">
            <p>This is the second project of a series of UX projects done for the Treehouse UX program.</p>
            <p>The first step I took into figuring out what direction I wanted to take with this app was research --
              which involved interviewing people on what their overall experiences were while grocery shopping.
              I interviewed those who were within my target audience -- those who were within their early 20s and above, and living on their own and/or grocery shops regularly.
            </p>
            <p>After gathering information from all the interviews, I analyzed what were the common pain points and began the prototyping to mockup process. </p>

            <p><b>Role</b>: Research, strategy, design</p>
            <p><b>Team</b>: Solo project</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>Grocery shopping experiences tend to be either a neutral or unpleasant experience for most people, however COVID-19 has increased some of these issues.
          This app will be the solution to the most common problem -- transparency with whether or not an item is in stock and where it is in store.
        </p>

    <div class="portfolio-section">
      <h1>Research</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Key areas of Inquiry</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Overall experiences with grocery shopping</li>
          <li>Lifestyle (before and after quarantine) </li>
          <li>In-store shopping process</li>
          <li>Shopping logistics: difficulties and pain points </li>
          <li>Experiences using a grocery app </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Interview</h2>
        <p>Five people were interviewed over video/voice calls, who were all within the target audience. </p>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>What are your thoughts on grocery shopping?</li>
          <li>How often do you do your grocery shopping? When was the last time? (before and after quarantine)</li>
          <li>How do you grocery shop? What’s your process?</li>
          <li>What part of grocery shopping do you find difficult in general?</li>
          <li>Have you used a grocery app before? How was your experience? Or would you consider using one especially during this time?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Majority of my participants see grocery shopping as a chore, and do it mostly out of necessity. </li>
          <li>There were many aspects of grocery shopping that they found frustrating, such as needing to take time out of their day to get groceries, which contributed to this negative feeling. </li>
          <li>Most people felt this especially during this quarantine, when they could not find desired items due to limited stock, and needing to resort to substitutions or giving up entirely.</li>
          <li>On the other hand, I found that some parts of grocery shopping were actually seen as enjoyable -- for example, some participants enjoyed using that time to just go outside and spend time with family and friends. </li>
          <li>Participants responded most positively when they were able to search for and purchase items that they really enjoyed, such as their favorite snacks.</li>
          <li>Regarding using a grocery app, I found that most have not used a grocery app or service before, and that there are mixed opinions on whether to try it out or not.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pain Points</h3>
        <p>The most important pain point is that too much time is wasted by hunting down specific items that may be unavailable.
          This is a concern that is more apparent during this pandemic, but a lot of time is required to search for that item, or having to research alternatives.
          Throughout all my interviews, this difficulty was definitely the most common, and solving this would greatly improve the target audience’s grocery shopping experience.

      <h1>Affinity Diagram</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>I took each major point and noted them in a diagram to get a better sense of what issues arose during each conversation I had with each of my interviewees.
          I also took the opportunity to get to know what their top three items when shopping were --  just for funsies.
        </p>

        <p>TODO: affinity diagram</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>One of the most common pain points I wanted to solve is making an app that features exactly where an item is in the store if it is in-stock,
          and similar alternative items if that exact item is not in-stock.
          I would like to make this information easily found in the app, either in the shopping list or browsing individual items in the catalog.
        </p>
        <p>For example, when looking at the shopping list, it will show items that are in stock and their in-store location, and show items that are out-of-stock and similar options when selected.
          Another feature I’d like to implement is to show users whether an item is low on stock and how many remain, and an estimated date it’ll be restocked.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>I took inspiration from popular shopping apps like Target app, Shipt, and Instacart during my ideation phase.
          Also looked at Pinterest and Dribbble for design inspiration for my features, layouts, colors, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Browse items: The homepage of the app will display the products that are available at the store, so that users can scroll through them to find an item they’re interested in.</li>
          <li>Access the shopping list: The user can view the items that they’ve added to their shopping list to reference what they need to search for. There are a couple ways to access this:</li>
          <li>Sketch 1: Swipe to the left or press on the menu icon on the top left to show the menu. Click on “my list” to go into the shopping list page.</li>
          <li>Sketch 2: Press on the list icon on the bottom navigation menu to access the shopping list. </li>
          <li>Check if desired items are in-stock: The shopping list would show all items that are in stock, as well as a separate list of items that are out of stock.</li>
          <li>Find item in-store: Clicking on each in-stock item will show the physical location of the item in-store, with information like section, aisle, and map.</li>
          <li>Find alternatives to items: Clicking on out-of-stock items will show similar items and when it’s estimated to restock.</li>
        </ol>

      <h1>Sketches and Iteration</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>TODO: add sketches</p>

        <p>TODO: add wireframes</p>

        <p>TODO: wireframe video</p>

        <h2>User Tests</h2>
        <p>I conducted user tests after selecting five users within the target audience, they tested out the wireframes version of the prototype. </p>

        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Very straightforward, easy to use UI. </li>
          <li>The various functions and elements look useful, like the map and location, notification options, estimated restock, and similar items list.</li>
          <li>Overall, enjoyed how informative and potentially time-saving this app could be. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What needs to change?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Font sizes for some of the text are too small, hard to read. For example, some of the text on the shopping list. </li>
          <li>Setting a default location outside of the shopping list instead of in the list. </li>
          <li>Swap the “+” and “-” on the quantity picker around, and make them bigger. Also adding the pickers to the shopping list.</li>
          <li>Have the option of removing an item in the shopping cart Also being able to do the same thing on the shopping list. </li>
          <li>Add more information to the checkout page -- coupon code input, and delivery or pickup.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Design Principles</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Elements</h2>
        <p>As it was my first time designing for mobile, I decided to make it straightforward for myself to design.
          I used an official UI template kit from Apple and downloaded their SF font to use directly with Adobe XD. </p>
        <p>With colors, I went with a set of colors that were similar to primary colors but more easier to the eye to the larger target age range of my users being adults.
          I wanted something with a color set that would serve more as an accent, rather than an all around color for each page.</p>
        <p>In terms of shapes, I went with curved edges with all boxes and buttons to create a sense of friendliness when using the app -- and it’s easier on the eyes.</p>

        <h2>Final Mockup</h2>
        <p>After gathering feedback from my user tests, I made some adjustments to create the final version of my prototype.</p>

        <h3>Adjustments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>More pages - Search, account/profile, and checkout. </li>
          <li>More functionality - swipe to delete an item in the shopping list and checkout. </li>
          <li>Minor design flaws expressed in the user tests - font sizes, quantity pickers, location settings, etc. </li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>
          In this project, I learned how to design mobile apps -- and not gonna lie I actually enjoyed this more than designing website pages.
          It has been a dream for me to be able to learn how to do that and I really like how nice and clean this came out for a first time mobile design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned about pain points of users and how much I need to know about my users before designing so I know how to create something based around their needs,
          rather than what I think they need. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the opportunity to use this project to learn how to design on Adobe XD after learning how to use Sketch in the previous project.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I would change next time is taking more time to look at more similar apps from competitors,
          and make comparison notes to see what they excel at and what could be improved -- and use it to make my app even stronger.
          I did take inspiration from apps like Instacart, Target app, and Shipt.
