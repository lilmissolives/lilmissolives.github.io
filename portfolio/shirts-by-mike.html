            <p>This is the first project of a series of three projects created for the Treehouse UX program.
            ShirtsByMike is a mock T-shirt online store that needed an overhaul and redesign in hopes that it would
            increase their sales and build a stronger customer base.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>The owner of ShirtsByMike envisioned a website that would connect more with their intended audience,
        which is comprised primarily of Treehouse students. Currently, the website looks dated and could use
        a refresh in their branding, as well as featured campaigns to keep users engaged.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Problems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our website is dated. Feel free to refresh the branding, if needed.</li>
          <li>The content looks stale; we want to keep it fresh with various campaigns.</li>
          <li>We are unable to highlight a featured t-shirt.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mostly ages 16-35</li>
          <li>Primarily based in the United States</li>
          <li>Treehouse students</li>
          <li>Lifelong learners</li>
          <li>Values community</li>
          <li>Playful</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We'd like to launch a featured t-shirt of the month. The goal is to increase t-shirt sales by providing a limited edition t-shirt.</li>
          <li>These are the success metrics:
            <ul>  
              <li>Increase sales by 20%</li>
              <li>Increase unique page visits by 10%</li>

      <h1>Before Design</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <a href="https://shirtsbymike.com/">Link to site for reference</a>

        <h2>Color</h2>
        Colors on this website were designed to be more impressionable to their users, as the color orange is the only non-monochromatic color being used.
        The usage of orange is most likely used to create a fun and outgoing atmosphere. It is meant to suit the young and enthusiastic audience
        that tends to be sociable and lifelong learners.

        <div class="color-grid">
          <div class="color-grid-item color1" style="background-color: #ff8500;"></div>
          <div class="text1">Tangy Orange<br/><span class="color-code">#FF8500</span></div>
          <div class="color-grid-item color2" style="background-color: #dddddd;"></div>
          <div class="text2">It's Grey<br/><span class="color-code">#DDDDDD</span></div>
          <div class="color-grid-item color3" style="background-color: #444f63;"></div>
          <div class="text3">Midnight<br/><span class="color-code">#444F63</span></div>
          <div class="color-grid-item color4" style="background-color: #3f4553;"></div>
          <div class="text4">Charcoal<br/><span class="color-code">#3F4553</span></div>
          <div class="color-grid-item color5" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></div>
          <div class="text5">White<br/><span class="color-code">#FFFFFF</span></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Shapes</h2>
        Rounded rectangles are used to display the merchandise, it creates organization between each item and provides structure.
        These rectangles also help create balance and framing throughout the site.
        The rounded corners of the product images provide a more approachable and friendly feeling, while the sharper corners of the pricing and sizing pages are more rigid and professional.

        <h2>Groupings</h2>
        Elements on the main page of the website are grouped well.
        The header is prominent and separated by the orange background, and the hero image provides an eye-catching feature of a product.
        The products are grouped by type (t-shirt and tank top), which make it easy to browse the selection and search for a product.
        <br /><br />
        On the product detail pages, the information about the product is grouped together,
        which is helpful when evaluating whether I (as a customer) am interested in purchasing it.
        At the bottom, there is a grouping of similar products.
        This is valuable, as if I’m looking at the product and have mixed feelings about buying it, or want to consider alternatives,
        there is an easy way to navigate and browse other similar products.

        <h2>Balance and Organization</h2>
        The main sections of the site are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Header</b>: featuring the company logo and introducing the rest of the website, with a convenient checkout/cart button on every page.
            It creates a sense of unity and consistency across all pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hero image</b>: this section is prominent and grabs the user’s attention, and introduces the kinds of products that the website sells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Product listings</b>: each product listed is accompanied by an image and a name, which is browseable and can be used to look for items to look into.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Product detail</b>: the image of the product takes up the majority of the screen, allowing the user to zoom in and take a closer look at the product.
            There is also a description of the product, its price, and available sizing. These are factors into a user’s decision of buying a product, and are clearly visible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Simplicity</b>: the website’s pages are very intuitive and easy to navigate.
            For example, clicking on a shirt brings me to the product’s listing page, with an embedded sizing and purchase form.
            Navigating back to the homepage requires just one click on the header’s logo.
            There are no complicated instructions needed to use this site, which is helpful for the target audience who may not have a design or tech background.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Consistent branding</b>: the website makes effective use of their branding by prominently featuring their logo across the website and even on product images.
            The target audience is one who values community, so they would be delighted to be a part of a community who wears this shirt, because the logo is featured on each product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Responsiveness</b>: the website works well on mobile and tablet devices, and elements are arranged/resized appropriately.
            This is perfect for the target audience, who are young professionals and typically spend most of their time on-the-go and away from a desktop computer.
            Making the browsing and checkout experience easier for mobile users will increase sales further.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>No space to feature the T-shirt of the month</b>: the current main attraction of the main page is the hero image, but doesn’t say anything about the featured product.
            Redesigning this area to allow us to feature a product, with detail about the campaign and a direct link to the product, will likely boost sales.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lack of modern design elements</b>: as noted in the stakeholder interview, the design should be revamped and made more appealing to younger audiences.
            While the color is a good start, the general design could use some improvements.
            The fonts could be more playful, and some UI elements like the buttons can be more dynamic and modern.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Repetition</b>: there is a lot of repetition in the product listings.
            Most of the products are the same designs, just with different colors, which adds clutter to the product listings section and makes it more difficult to browse.
            Ideally, this could be simplified by allowing the user to select their desired color in the product detail page, which will dynamically recolor the product image.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a></h3>
        <p>
          This website is very effective at grabbing users’ attention with ongoing sales and promotions.
          Once a user visits the main page, they are greeted with a popup with information about the latest sale.
          While this may seem effective, this could be a potential weakness, as some users may be turned off by the intrusiveness of the popup ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sales listed are also time-sensitive with a countdown, which creates a sense of urgency - likely helping to increase sales.
          For the redesign, it would be great to feature sales and promotions more prominently by taking advantage of the hero banner and marking individual items as discounted.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.threadless.com/">Threadless</a></h3>
        <p>
          The website’s main page has a section that features real customers’ reviews.
          Since the target audience enjoys being part of a community, they can read reviews from other people similar to them in the community.
          This can make it more likely for someone to purchase a product, if it is already worn and approved by a peer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the website’s product pages have social media share buttons, which make it easy to share products with their community.
          If we add this to the redesign, this would allow users to share products with their network, which can increase unique page views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Threadless is a great example of a website that is able to sell to their audience with their features and content.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.designbyhumans.com/">Design by Humans</a></h3>
        <p>
          Overall, the color scheme on the website seems very monochromatic.
          The text and backgrounds are all some shade of white or black, which looks good as a concept, but lacks the playfulness that the targeted audience expects from a fun t-shirt website.
          Ideally, the website can use an additional accent color (e.g. orange for Shirts By Mike).
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the main page does not feature any products or promotions, which adds friction to a user’s experience of jumping directly to a product’s detail page and checking out.
        </p>

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        To gather information and understand where the client is coming from, I...
        <ul>
          <li>Examined the original ShirtsByMike website and noted down what I saw and what could be improved.</li>
          <li>Took note of what features the competitors had, what their strengths and weaknesses were.</li>
          <li>Created target user personas, plus journey and empathy maps to further understand the users that are using this site.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Competitors</h2>
        <p>I researched other websites in the T-shirt space and enumerated the similarities, differences, and selling points from each site.
          I assessed the strengths of each website, and incorporated them into my proposed designs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Teepublic</li>
          <li>Threadless</li>
          <li>Design By Humans</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also looked at other websites for further inspiration for modern clothing sites, Everlane and Madewell.
          Though their target audience is not exactly the same, there were some similarities such as the target age range of shoppers and design philosophies. </p>


        <h2>Critique of the current solution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>No space to feature the T-shirt of the month</b>: the current main attraction of the main page is the hero image, but doesn’t say anything about the featured product.

      <h1>User Journey and Empathy Map</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">

        <h3>Goals & Needs</h3>
        Anthony wants to be able to express themselves with affordable and fun apparel that makes them feel a part of a learning community.
        He would prefer to shop at a website that showcases all apparel in a visually pleasing way that is organized and easy to navigate. 

        <h3>Behaviors</h3>
        He tends to be outgoing, busy balancing studying and working, involved in their clubs or communities, low maintenance but expressive when it comes to personal style.
        
        <h3>Frustrations</h3>
        Not a fan of shopping, would like to spend the least amount of time possible shopping for clothes so he can have time for either studying or social activities.

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        I made several assumptions of what I believe my users wanted based on my research.
        <ul>  
          <li>More selectivity of products — periodically featuring limited/exclusive shirts or sales to keep the customer base interested. </li>
          <li>An updated website with more aesthetically pleasing yet functional features that match the brand. </li>
          <li>A review section for each product so users can have higher confidence in their purchase and be persuaded in one way or another. </li>
          <li>Social media sites to keep users connected and another means of contact with the brand. </li>
          <li>Mobile-friendly website for accessing the site on the go.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h1>Assumptions</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        I made several assumptions of what I believe my users wanted based on my research.
        <ul>  
          <li>More scarcity with products -- limited/exclusive shirts or sales to keep the customer base interested. </li>
          <li>An updated website with more aesthetically pleasing yet functional features what matches the theme of the brand. </li>
          <li>A review section for each product so users know exactly what to expect. </li>
          <li>Social media sites to keep users connected and another means of contact with the brand. </li>
          <li>Mobile friendly website.</li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
          <li>I think users would like more exclusive shirts and/or limited deals to be featured as it creates scarcity that creates more sales quickly as customers want more unique and desirable items.</li>
          <li>Similar to the previous assumption, the store could have a shipping deal where free shipping is offered for a limited time and/or buying a certain amount of items to get free or express shipping.</li>
          <li>I think users are unsatisfied with the repetition of similar products on the current website.</li>
          <li>Also a more updated website will help appeal to their typical age group being people in their early 20s, making the design more aesthetically pleasing yet simple and playful design will definitely improve customer experience.</li>
          <li>I think users would like a review section for each product, so they know what opinions are of the shirts, shipping, and possibly customer service they are receiving from other customers. </li>
          <li>Since most users are most likely acquired through the Treehouse program, search keywords, or word of mouth, it would be nice if their social media pages were functioning so there are communities based on these platforms, and so the brand can feel more at touch with their customers. Also users are able to be notified of future deals and offers if they follow their social media page or email subscription.</li>
          <li>Mobile friendly site is always good, especially since users would like to compare the same product but in various colors on a single page, and have less tabs or back and forth between pages as possible when comparing different tops.</li>

      <h1>Sketches and Iteration</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>I tried out two different ideas for each page, each having different elements but accomplishing the same issue. </p>
        <p>Much of my inspiration came from Pinterest, Dribbble, the three competitors (Teepublic, Design By Humans, and Threadless), and modern fashion websites (H&M, Everlane, Madewell). </p>

        <p>TODO: add moodboard</p>

        <!-- I tried out two different ideas for each page, each having some different elements but accomplishing the same issue.
        <h2>Homepage</h2>
        <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation bar is on the left side in which it would follow along with the user scrolling down on the page.</li>
          <li>Also serves as a footer for social media links.</li>
          <li>Links to shirts, tank tops, and help may have a drop down for specific links to pages.</li>
          <li>Header image where it would display an image of any announcements like deals, sales, and new arrivals. Within the image, there is a link to the page for the announcement.</li>
          <li>There are images that are also clickable links for each main section like shirts and tank tops.</li>
          <li>Image to sign up for regular newsletters or account sign up has a text box to fill in the email address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sketch 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation bar is on the top -- also able to follow when scrolled down.</li>
          <li>Also includes a header image that accomplishes the same idea as homepage #1 but is larger and keeps the navigation bar transparent until scrolled down.</li>
          <li>Featured shirts as a section below header image to showcase three selected products. This also would include the price of each product along with the titles to reduce the amount of clicking in between pages.</li>
          <li>Photo row section to display images from Instagram users and a link to the instagram account for Shirts By Mike -- this creates a sense of community for users visiting the site.</li>
          <li>Footer on the bottom of the page which includes the index to each page, email sign up, and social media pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Catalog</h2>
        <h3>Sketch 1 and 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Header image is used to present the specific catalog section, for example “shirts” catalog header image would have images of at least one of the t-shirts along with text.</li>
          <li>Tank tops and T-shirts are on different pages in order to better present each product and make it easier for users to browse through.</li>
          <li>Each product is displayed as a grid with titles, price, and colors available.</li>
          <li>Resolves the issues of the original website -- prices undisplayed and shirts with the same design can be organized into a single page where other colors can be viewed.</li>
          <li>Individual product details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sketch 1 and 2</h3>

          <li>Each page resolves the major flaws that the original web page has and adds what was lacking -- reviews, fit guide, multiple photos, and color choices, favorite button.</li>
          <li>Each feature would definitely help assist customers with their purchasing decisions and increase sales.</li>
          <li>Improvements on original content -- layout and aesthetic improvements, adding a price to the recommended/ similar products section, consolidation of varied colored but same products into a single page.</li>
          <li>Reviews section will be a definite help for customers when selecting a product, with a star rating on the top of the details section and user reviews below.
            It can also inform how popular the product is and how others feel about it in order for customers to make an informed purchase.</li>
          <li>Color selection prevents the issue of viewing the same products in multiple pages or tabs.</li>
          <li>Sketch #2 -- usage of color block on the left side adds accent and contrast to the page, and allows a space for orange to be used as it is the signature color of the brand.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contact Page</h2>
        <h3>Sketch 1 and 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The forms are kept simple with an area to fill out name, email, and message boxes. </li>
          <li>Having a cute image of the frog mascot on the side makes this more unique and possibly more encouraging for someone to reach out.</li>
          <li>Social media links are included on the bottom in case they want to contact through there, with a message “Slide into our DM’s!” as a fun and modern way to encourage contact with the store.</li>
          <li>Sketch 2 includes the color block idea from individual products detail page 2, to also create a contrast on the page.</li>
        </ul> -->

        <p>TODO: add sketches</p>

        <p>After sketching out the wireframes, I took the best of both worlds of both ideas and then added some new ideas.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>I added an Instagram section to the homepage, so it shows visitors that there are real customers buying these products and wearing them.</li>
          <li>Some details I adjusted completely from the sketch — for the individual product page I rearranged the details area to be more towards the top rather than below the “add to cart”.
            I also added an area for images for the reviews section as I realized that photos are always very helpful for users.</li>
          <li>Initially, I wanted to also include the footer to the side navigation bar but I found that it made more sense to have an actual footer on the bottom of the page to tie the pages up.
            It felt like there was not a conclusion to the web pages until I added that in, and those who critiqued it suggested that I add it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Optimizing for Mobile</h2>
        <p>Some aspects of the original desktop site had to be simplified or hidden entirely in order to create the site mobile-friendly. </p>
        <p>For example, for hiding elements, I had a left facing navigation bar — so I decided to place it into a hamburger menu for users to press or swipe out to view.
          With the search bar, I placed it into a search icon that would drop down after being pressed. </p>
        <p>For simplifying, both the Instagram and product page, I created an image carousel for the photos in order to save screen space.
          In the catalog page, I downsized the elements into a double column grid for better view and flow.
          As a result of this, I added a “swipe down for more” at the bottom so users can easily go to the next page below to load and see more products. </p>
        <p>Similarly with the desktop wireframe pages, I adjusted the footer to match more with the content.
          However, I simplified the sections to reduce clutter, and avoid overcrowding the mobile page or making the links too small to click on.</p>

        <h2>Refreshing the brand</h2>
        <p>In order to make the website more appealing and refreshing, I came up with a new palette with various complementary colors. I kept an orange color as a nod to the original design,
          so that the change is more familiar and not as jarring to prior visitors of the page.
          I wanted a palette that gives off a vibrant and fun vibe, on top of exuding a casual and warm personality.</p>
        <p>The entirety of the text on the site is Brandon Grotesque, a sans serif font, which I chose for its warm and functional look.</p>
        <p>I also felt that the logo needed an update to better match with the new style of the website — this would also give me another graphic I can add to a shirt.
          I wanted to keep some elements of the old logo (like the leaf) as a homage to the original, but featuring Mike the Frog more prominently so that users can easily associate him with the brand.</p>

        <h2>Designing for Mobile</h2>
        <p>In designing the website for mobile visitors, I wanted to preserve the same theme and experience as the desktop version.
          The intent was to provide a sense of familiarity and brand stickiness such that the mobile site feels united with the desktop.</p>

        <p>Though most of the same components and text are ported over almost exactly, I resized a lot of them to fit within the much more narrow screen dimensions.
          Text was also enlarged in certain places for easier reading, and components are stacked more vertically instead of horizontally to accommodate users scrolling up and down on their phone.
          Like the desktop site, I wanted to maintain a consistent header and footer on each page of the website — with the main difference being that we don’t have as much screen space to work with on mobile.
          I condensed the header by using large icons to symbolize buttons that the user can press (e.g. search bar to search the site), that way there is more screen space to view the main content of the page.</p>

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>
          From this project, I learned about what goes into a good website design.
          It’s not just about the layout, typography, and visuals — what’s really important is the brand and how it is received by the target audience.
          It’s also not enough for a website to be visually stunning, it must also take into account who the user is and how they would interact with the site.
          As a result, the tone of voice and content of the website also matter a lot, and connecting that with the design of the site is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned a lot from checking out references of other apparel websites, how they incorporate their brand into the site design, and how they utilize color and typography.
          This gave me a lot of good ideas and inspiration for my own site design.
        </p>

        <h2>What I would do differently next time</h2>
        <p>
          I would add more content to the website that provides more active community engagement.
          For example, I would include Instagram and Twitter contests that promote the brand and encourage the users to share the website more broadly.
          In general, having more lively color and illustrations could help tie the pages together and showcase the dynamicness and liveliness of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I would include more information about the company itself — there is currently minimal information about the brand, and what “sustainability” really means for the company and how they would achieve it.
          It would also be insightful to add some narrative about the brand and its origin so that visitors can learn about the site they’re shopping from, which would give them more confidence and trust in it.
