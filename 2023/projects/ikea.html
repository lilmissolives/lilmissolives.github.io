            This was my submission for an Uplabs weekly design challenge, where
            the prompt was to redesign IKEA's shopping app. I worked on this as
            a solo project over the span of 2 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            IKEA is one of the most popular home furnishing brands globally with
            its variety of Scandinavian designs to suit a range of living
            aesthetics with affordability. They have a wide catalog of products
            on both their website and app — which many shop and order directly
            from. However, there are some features that could be improved or
            added to create an even better shopping experience.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>
          My first step into taking on this challenge was downloading the app,
          using it myself, and taking notes of my impressions and pain points.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Parity with web experience</b>: The app is missing some features
            and organized differently from the website, especially when
            searching for products. For example, in-stock availability is not
            shown in filter options, and color options for a given item are all
            displayed separately rather than grouped together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Redundant options</b>: The new experience toggle on the search
            page seems unnecessary since both options essentially give the same
            experience/result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>In-app scanning feature</b>: I shop in-store at my local IKEA
            warehouse, and would appreciate an in-app scanner rather than just
            taking pictures of the item tags using my phone's camera app. The
            only usage of the camera is for room planning and scanning in-store
            that only works with certain warehouses. I understand that this is
            an existing feature in those certain warehouses but I want something
            that can be feasibly used across all warehouses without the need for
            QR codes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>More intuitive UI</b>: “Customize it” button behavior for some
            products could be more intuitive - I would rather see all options in
            one place than a separate pop-up page.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Afterwards, I looked into the app's reviews in the Google Play Store
          and took note of some of the most common pain points users have
          mentioned.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Frustrating to find certain items because of Swedish naming unless
            you memorize them
          </li>
          <li>
            Unable to filter for in-stock items when searching, or by stock in
            specific location
          </li>
          <li>
            Would prefer highlighting unavailable products so they're easier to
            remove from cart. Only available options are to delete it or save
            for later.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          From my research, it seems like the
          <b>biggest pain point to resolve</b> is the issue of conflicting item
          availability information between in-store stock and online.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2020, IKEA has been going through supply chain shortages and
          limited stock of some of their items. This leads to frustration and
          confusion from many customers who are seeking to purchase certain
          items on their website or app only to see it be unavailable
          indefinitely, despite still being listed online.
        </p>

      <h1>Ideation</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <p>
          As this was meant to be a quick challenge with a deadline, I mostly
          focused on solving the main pain points I observed while using the app
          and several improvements to the overall design.
        </p>

        <p>I identified three areas for improvement:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Improve in-stock availability when searching and in shopping cart
          </li>
          <li>Utilizing the camera for in person shopping experience</li>
          <li>
            Redesign product pages to better present information and utilization
            of space
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I researched other commerce apps (Amazon, Target) and looked at
          inspiration from related ideas on Dribbble and the Figma community,
          plus some past submissions for similar prompts on Uplabs. Afterwards,
          I drew up some initial sketches before moving over to Figma to create
          a set of wireframes.

      <h1>Takeaways</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest things I've learned was how to connect and
          integrate online and physical shopping elements. As most of IKEA's
          revenue comes from in-store shopping, there could be more digital
          integration with walking around the showroom to the warehouse for
          example. I find that most shoppers, including myself, will take photos
          of tags for products I am interested in to save for later. However,
          this means these photos will be saved on my phone's storage and
          possibly forgotten, whereas the IKEA app can easily scan the product I
          want and save to a list for viewing later, view all color options, or
          directly add to my cart. Not only does this make for a more organized
          and streamlined shopping experience for customers, this could also
          lead to increased sales and conversion rates for IKEA.
        </p>

        <p>
          One small thing that I learned in this project was how to design based
          off of an existing design system - in other words, according to the
          challenge's prompt: “keeping their sleek and Scandinavian approach in
          mind”. I had learned to do this in my previous internships, however
          this time I did not have the official components on hand. Thankfully,
          IKEA's design system is very straightforward with its blue and yellow
          color scheme and single font, Noto Sans.
        </p>

        <h2>What I would improve for next time</h2>
        <p>
          As this was a short project, I only focused on a few areas I saw
          immediately that could use improvement. If given more time, I would
          create the “Scan tag camera” screen and connect it to the “Add to
          list/Favorites” screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interaction I would consider is if a user wanted to add an out
          of stock item from the product page. Based on current interactions in
          the app, IKEA allows users to add out-of-stock items to their cart,
          but leads to later frustration when they find out they can't purchase
          it during checkout. I would add a feature that notifies users that the
          item is out of stock, and gives them an option to notify them again
          when it's back in-stock.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noted that one user in a review mentioned that they had a hard time
          shopping at IKEA because of the Swedish naming system. I felt that it
          is its own challenge that can be explored well on its own that a
          short-term project tackling various features would not be able to
          accomplish fully. Hence why I added names of the products below in the
          search history section in the Explore page – it may help jog some
          memory for users. This is also why I added examples of search queries
          on the search bar rather than their original “what are you looking
          for?”, which I found rather vague.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I thought this was a fun short challenge for me to study an
          existing brand and do research on how I can make their app even better
          for their customers. This is the first project where I take a real
          existing brand's app (and one I use personally) to find ways to
          improve the experience.
