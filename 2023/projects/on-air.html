          To address these common pain points from remote life, I sought to

          work or attend classes remotely.

        <p>
          Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have had to
          make the sudden switch over to work from home or distance learning. As
          a result, people have to work around their housemates or their
          families who may either be in their own meetings, or unaware that they
          are causing a disturbance in the background. Sometimes, a workaround
          is just to let others know ahead of time, post signs outside your
          door, or simply send a message to the household group chat. However,
          these solutions are very manual and not always perfect, as people can
          often forget to notify their housemates – leaving them unaware.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've come across some creative ideas that people have come up with to
          mitigate these disturbances, for example:
        </p>

            loading="lazy"
          />

        <div class="centered-img">

            width="840"
            height="472"

            title="YouTube video player"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
        </div>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          The classic radio “on air” light box is exactly where I got my
          inspiration for the theme of this idea – but I wanted to design one
          that is more accessible to people and doesn't require hardware. While
          a physical device has its own charms, not everybody has the time or
          means to purchase or build an actual “On-Air” light box sign.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to solve this problem in a generalizable and consistent way,
          especially as working from home and remote learning become more and
          more widespread and normalized — even after the pandemic. This idea
          could also apply to users who do regular streaming on sites like
          Twitch, to those who do casual video/audio calling, and even to those
          who just don’t want to be disturbed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Personally, I got most of my inspiration from living with my partner –
          who is in meetings often throughout the day as he's been working from
          home since the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, I've had
          moments where I suddenly forget that he's in a meeting and made loud
          distracting sounds (e.g. grinding coffee beans or using the ice
          dispenser, as our "home office" is in the same room as the kitchen).
        </p>

        <p>
          As a user, it would also be nice to have a visual, unobstrusive way to
          see if my partner is currently in a meeting, check how long it’s
          supposed to run until, and see a schedule without having access to his
          calendar. Likewise, for him, it would give him a way to discreetly
          tell me that I'm being too loud without having to sneakily message me
          on his phone.
        </p>

            I started out by sketching a few screens to get an idea of what kind

      <h1>Design System</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Dark mode default</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, I debated whether or not to make dark mode the primary
          theme, as it’s usually an opt-in feature in apps that’s mainly
          utilized when viewing at night or in a dark room. However, I think it
          pairs well with the theme and mood that I'm trying to go for - radio
          studio inspired with neon aesthetics. I thought it was a good
          opportunity given that more and more apps these days are implementing
          dark mode as an optional feature or creating apps with a default dark
          theme – and it was a personal challenge for myself as I hadn’t
          designed with a dark theme before. However, I did recognize that it's
          strange for an app to utilize dark mode as a default especially if
          it's mainly going to be used during the daytime. Given that indoor
          lighting levels can vary for everyone’s home office space, having the
          option to switch between light and dark mode would be ideal.
        </p>

        <h2>Color scheme</h2>
        <p>
          I envisioned a bright color scheme to contrast and pair well with the
          dark theme — neon colored signs were one of my inspirations. My first
          step into this exploration was creating a mood/inspiration board with
          neon signs and logos that incorporate this theme. I then took a color
          picker and picked out colors that I felt would work best, and had some
          similarity with common neon sign colors. One thing was for sure: I had
          the color red in mind to be a primary color for main features — for
          example, the going "on-air" button.
        </p>

        <h2>Glass morphism</h2>
        <p>
          Another aspect of radio studio aesthetics that I drew inspiration from
          was the glass windows leading into the broadcasting studio rooms where
          professionals go live. I utilized this effect in certain features,
          like the navigation bar, calendar schedule, and the adding meetings
          feature.

      <h1>What I learned</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Working in dark mode</h2>
        <p>
          As I mentioned previously, I thought this would be a good challenge
          for me to learn how to design in dark mode. Most apps are light by
          default — but that is slowly changing as more and more apps are
          providing dark mode as an option. I really do enjoy dark mode options
          personally, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to create
          my own. It was interesting having to navigate with negative space,
          rather than the positive space I'm used to working in. My biggest
          challenge was how to make colors stand out without making them too
          overwhelming — especially with the neon-ish palette I chose. The
          question I wanted to answer was: how do I strike a balance with the
          usage of (bright) colors amongst the dark background?
        </p>

        <h2>Color palette</h2>
        <p>
          I normally don't choose bright neon colors as a theme, or in general,
          but I felt this would also be a good way for me to see how well I can
          work with a brighter color palette. In retrospect, I could have chosen
          a better set of colors to work with that's more subdued yet still
          neon-like and still get the theme across. However, I don't think it
          looks too bad as I was basing these colors from neon signs.
        </p>

        <h2>Fine-tuning animations</h2>
        <p>
          I'm still learning and adjusting to using Figma as my default program
          after using Sketch throughout my internship — and studying all three
          UI programs simultaneously during my bootcamp (Sketch, Adobe XD, and
          Figma). I previously knew how to prototype in Adobe XD and somewhat in
          Figma, but it was a challenge to not be able to really make seamless
          animations as easily as I could in XD. As a result of this project, I
          learned how to time the animations so that it feels more fluid and
          timely when they go off, and organize my components better so Figma
          can properly animate the transitions. Also, I learned how to work with
          different styles of animations, such as slide-ins, auto-animation,
          delays, dragging, etc. I still have a ways to go to fully understand
          how to use the many animation features, but this project gave me a
          great insight into it.

      <h1>What I would do differently</h1>
      <div class="portfolio-description">
        <h2>Improved notification system</h2>
        <p>
          As I was wrapping up my prototypes, I realized it could be useful to
          be able to send notifications to more than one person or the entire
          household at once, instead of just a single person currently. There
          could be scenarios where the user hears noises outside but isn’t sure
          who is causing the disturbances. For these situations, I would
          consider building a feature to broadcast a message to multiple people.
        </p>

        <h2>Explore more color palettes</h2>
        <p>
          Despite how much I researched and experimented with various neon and
          bright colors – I don’t feel like I am fully satisfied with the final
          palette. To be fair, neon colors are not my forte, so it was difficult
          to select a set of colors that work well together. I wish I had set
          aside more time to consider more sets of colors, rather than settling
          on a palette that I put together relatively quickly.
          Accessibility-wise, I would have also considered alternative color
          palettes or making sure the colors I chose are inclusive for those
          with color blindness.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical integration</h2>
        <p>
          It would make things much more streamlined for users to be able to
          connect their calendar apps and have the schedules automatically sync
          into the On Air app, rather than having to manually add events into
          the app itself. I had considered this feature in my early ideations,
          but if I had to revisit this project again, I would absolutely look
          into building first-class support for this.
